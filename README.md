# KivaLens

Interactive Power BI dashboard for Kiva loan applications, enhanced with LDA-based topic modeling from unstructured loan text data.

In this project, I masterfully combined advanced natural language processing and interactive data visualization to uncover deep insights from global Kiva loan applications. Employing Gensim’s Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, I extracted meaningful thematic patterns that span regions, sectors, and time. These insights were seamlessly integrated into a Power BI dashboard featuring interactive KPIs, geospatial visualizations, and trend analyses, enabling stakeholders to explore risk factors and loan distribution dynamically. The project showcases my unique ability to translate complex, unstructured text data into compelling business narratives through sophisticated NLP and intuitive storytelling. By empowering users to interactively explore data, I bridge the gap between raw analytics and strategic decision-making. This repository illustrates how deep technical expertise paired with a storyteller’s mindset can produce dashboards that not only inform but inspire.



## Overview

This project visualizes loan trends, risks, and themes across regions using geospatial maps, KPIs, and NLP-based insights derived from Gensim’s LDA.

## Tools Used

Power BI (DAX, data modeling, KPIs)
Python (Gensim, Pandas)
Geospatial visualizations
Topic modeling with LDA

## Features

Regional loan distribution & repayment trends
Dynamic filters for country, sector, and time
NLP-driven topic clustering across loan descriptions

## Key Insights

Identified funding patterns by region/sector
Revealed hidden themes (e.g., agriculture vs. education loans)
Made unstructured data actionable and visual

## Structure
